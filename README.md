TASK

This trail project is a way for you to show your refactoring skills and ability to use java tools.

Here is the tasks list:
* Do GildedRose refactoring kata in Java (https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata). Make code readable and maintainable.
* Upgrade item update algorithm to process items asynchronously.
* Implement GildedRose items rest service (only items list endpoint) in Spring Boot (https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) application using previously refactored code. Use Elasticsearch as database for Items (or MongoDB, or Redis). Items update must happen once a day.

Non functional requirements:
* Source code should be provided in GIT repository (github.com, bitbucket.org, gitlab.com or other platform).
* Do commit early and often.
* Cover your solution with tests.
* Use some ​Java 8​ features where it makes sense.

P.S. You can provide partial solution along with descriptions or diagrams how it would be done.
